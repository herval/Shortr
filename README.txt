== DESCRIPTION:

Shortr is a wrapper around different URL shortening sites. It shortens stuff.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Support for migre.me

== SYNOPSIS:

  You can shorten any url by calling:

  Shortr.for("http://yourstuffhere.com")

  The default (and only implemented) shortening service right now is http://migre.me - it's simple, doesn't require any API keys and it's what we're using anyway.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* None, really... An Internet connection is a nice to have, though :-)

== INSTALL:

* "gem install shortr" and you're good to go!
